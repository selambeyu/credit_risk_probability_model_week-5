## Credit Scoring Business Understanding

### Introduction
Credit risk refers to the likelihood that a borrower will default on a loan or fail to meet contractual debt obligations. In other words, it's the risk that money lent out wonâ€™t be paid back as agreed.

There are different types of credit risk:

- Default Risk: The borrower fails to pay the loan entirely.

- Credit Migration Risk: The borrowerâ€™s credit quality worsens, making future default more likely.

- Settlement Risk: The borrower fails to meet terms after both parties agree on a transaction.

According to the Basel III framework, credit risk is defined as the potential that a bank borrower or counterparty will fail to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed terms.

### 1. How does the Basel II Accordâ€™s emphasis on risk measurement influence our need for an interpretable and well-documented model?

The Basel II Accord introduces a structured framework for measuring and managing credit risk by emphasizing the need for Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approaches. These approaches require financial institutions to justify risk estimates using transparent and auditable models. As a result, it is critical to develop interpretable and well-documented models to ensure regulatory compliance, facilitate internal audit and validation, and support effective risk-based capital allocation. Interpretable models allow stakeholders to understand the rationale behind risk predictions, which is essential for trust and accountability.

### 2. Since we lack a direct "default" label, why is creating a proxy variable necessary, and what are the potential business risks of making predictions based on this proxy?

In the absence of a true "default" label, a proxy variableâ€”such as 90+ days past dueâ€”is often created to approximate default behavior. This proxy enables supervised learning, but introduces uncertainty due to possible misclassification. If the proxy does not accurately reflect real default events, the model may misidentify risky borrowers or overlook genuine defaulters, leading to poor lending decisions. This can result in financial loss, regulatory penalties, or reputational damage for the institution.

### 3. What are the key trade-offs between using a simple, interpretable model (like Logistic Regression with WoE) versus a complex, high-performance model (like Gradient Boosting) in a regulated financial context?

Simple models like Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence (WoE) offer high interpretability, regulatory transparency, and easier implementation. They are preferred in regulated contexts where explainability is critical. However, they may underperform in capturing complex, nonlinear patterns in data. In contrast, complex models like Gradient Boosting can deliver higher predictive accuracy but often lack interpretability, making them harder to validate, audit, and explain. In regulated environments, the trade-off must balance performance with compliance, risk governance, and business trust.


### Final Thoughts
Credit risk is not just a banking problem â€” it's a human issue. Itâ€™s about trust, responsibility, and making smart, data-driven decisions when money is on the line.

As we build better models and improve data availability, we can offer fairer, faster, and more inclusive financial services â€” without taking unnecessary risks.
